# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier with the Iris Dataset

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier using the classic Iris dataset. The model is trained and validated using Scikit-learn's tools, and predictions are made for an unseen flower sample.

## Features

- **Dataset**:
  - Uses the built-in Iris dataset from Scikit-learn.
  - Contains 150 samples of iris flowers classified into 3 species:
    - `setosa`
    - `versicolor`
    - `virginica`

- **K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier**:
  - Trains a KNN model with a specified number of neighbors (`n_neighbors=3`).
  - Predicts the species of an unknown iris sample based on its measurements.

- **Train-Test Split**:
  - Splits the dataset into 75% training and
